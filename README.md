# Creating Dynamic Reports from your Shiny App
## Slides

So, you've created your wonderful, interactive Shiny app. But now you'd like to provide your users with a custom report that they can download. In this workshop, we'll start with a basic ready-made Shiny app (no need to build/bring your own!) and go over several packages that you can use to create dynamic reports with reactive Shiny elements.

These slides were originally developed for R-Ladies St. Louis and presented by Sonja Winter.
